Hi there! :wave: I'm Xinyuan Li, a third-year undergraduate student at Zhejiang University. My research interests lie at the intersection of spatial reasoning, multimodality, reinforcement learning, and ai agents. Currently, I'm a research intern at the NU-MLL-Lab, where I have the privilege of being advised by Professor Manling Li.
