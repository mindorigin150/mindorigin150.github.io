I am a **junior** student at **Zhejiang University**, majoring in **Control Science and Engineering**. In addition, I am enrolled in the **ACEE Honors Program** at **Chu Kochen Honors College** and have completed extensive coursework in **Computer Science**.



### Research Interests
- **Foundation Models:** Exploring VLMs and UMMs to enhance reasoning capabilities.
- **Embodied AI & Robotics:** Developing VLAs models and generalist agents capable of executing complex tasks in open-world environments.
- **World Models & Video Generation:** Leveraging **Video Generation** as scalable **World Models** to serve as interactive environments for VLA training and **RL reward.** I am particularly interested in:
  - **Physical Grounding:** Improve the **physical consistency** of generative models to reflect real-world dynamics accurately.
  - **Efficiency:** Optimizing **Inference acceleration** for video generation to enable high-throughput simulation for reinforcement learning.



### Research Projects
Currently I have an on-going project regarding **cross-view spatial consistency** with Prof. Manling Li at Northwestern University as well as senior PhDs, targeting ECCV 2026!
